## Statistics
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/40%20Statistics/Basics%20of%20Statistics.pdf">Basics of Statistics</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 7 hrs</summary>
    One of the best survey courses in statistics. Basic concepts of biomedical statistics are discussed: measures of central tendency, basics of exploratory data analysis, central limit theorem (given not quite correctly), confidence intervals, statistical inference, t-distribution, analysis of variance, correlation and regression analysis.

    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/40%20Statistics/Data%20Analysis%20in%20R.pdf">Data Analysis in R</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 16 hrs</summary>
    The course covers the elements of working with statistics in the R program environment. The theory is minimal but generally sufficient. The syntax of R as applied to statistical calculations, descriptive statistics, graphing, analyzing nominal data, comparing groups, analysis of variance, and creating custom functions are covered. Correlation and multiple linear regression, methods of model selection and diagnosis are also discussed. A few words are devoted to logistic regression. Practical assignments are quite solvable, but their complexity and content do not correspond well to the theory presented.

## Python
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/PyGen%20for%20beginners%20(Python).pdf">"PyGen" for beginners</a> by BEEGEEK, 40 hrs</summary>
    It is an excellent course, absolutely recommended for beginners and those wishing to refresh their Python knowledge from the beginning. The theory is concise clear, but not dry. It is sufficient for solving the proposed problems. The tasks are well chosen: they not only reinforce the theory but also train algorithmic thinking. The course covers data input-output, integer arithmetic, conditional operator, basic data types, loops, indexing, slices, string methods, lists and their methods, list comprehension, sorting, functions with and without parameters, functions with value return, local and global scopes. At the end, mini-projects are given to consolidate the studied topics.

    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/PyGen%20for%20advanced%20(Python).pdf">"PyGen" for advanced</a> by BEEGEEK, 64 hrs</summary>
    A congenial continuation of the first part for beginners. Theory and practice are equally well presented. The course begins with tasks to review what was learned in the first course (or to determine the need to go through it first). Next, we examine the data type bool, NoneType, nested lists, matrices (tasks are outstanding, for example, traversing a matrix in a spiral), operations on them in mathematics, tuples, sets, frozenset, set generators, dictionaries, their methods and generators, random modules, string, decimal, fraction, complex, turtle, functions: optional and named arguments, functions with a variable number of arguments, programming paradigms, functions as objects, higher-order functions, map(), filter(), reduce(), anonymous functions, any(), all(), zip(), enumerate(), working with files (input-output).

## SQL
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/30%20SQL/SQL%20for%20everyone.pdf">SQL for everyone</a> by I. Kim, 11 hrs</summary>
    A short and particular course on SQL (MSSQL) - the best I've seen. Training takes place on an actual database using Azure Data Studio. Taught by a strong practitioner: nothing extra (for a data analyst) in theory, the tasks resemble real work. Syntax elements to learn: WHERE, LIKE, AND, OR, ORDER BY, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, AS, GROUP BY, HAVING, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, UNION (ALL), Subqueries, CASE , Popular functions to work with the strings. Self-test tasks are given both after each lesson on the topic of this lesson and at the end of the course.

## System administration
- <details>
    <summary>★★☆☆☆ <a href="Certificates/50%20System%20Administration/Introduction%20to%20Linux.pdf">Intro to Linux</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 10 hrs</summary>
    An overview course for beginners getting to know Linux. There is a lot to see, but overall, it is not very good. The information is presented in a cluttered manner, and there are too many specific tasks. The course covers the basics of Terminal, launching executable files, input/output, downloading files, working with archives, searching for files and words in files, working on the server, bash scripts and more.
</details>

## Math
- <details>
    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/10%20Math/Math %20Logic%20and%20Theory%20of%20Algorithms.pdf">Math Logic & Algorithms Theory</a> by TUSUR University, 10 hrs</summary>
    The course as a whole is good as an introductory one, but the theory is presented rather dryly. Formalisms concerning the foundations of mathematical logic, set theory, propositional logic, first-order languages, the axiomatic method, mathematical proof, and the theory of algorithms are covered.
