    <summary>★☆☆☆☆ <a href="Certificates/60%20Biology/Intro%20to%20Molecular%20Biology%20and%20Biomedicine.pdf">Intro to MolBio & Biomedicine</a> by MIPT, 2 hrs</summary>
    A simple, ultra-short course introducing non-biologists to biomedicine. At a superficial level, issues familiar to schoolchildren are addressed: the role of nucleic acids, and proteins, the basics of genetics and evolution, drug design and the use of genomic data. I expected more from MIPT.

    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/60%20Biology/Molecular%20Biology%20and%20Genetics.pdf">MolBio & Genetics</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 4 hrs</summary>
    It is a review course recommended for refreshing the knowledge of molecular biology. General concepts of cellular and molecular biology are considered, and problems in genetics are also present. It can be difficult for beginners; lecturers lack experience.

    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/60%20Biology/Molecular%20Biology%20of%20the%20Cell.pdf">MolBio of the Cell</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 9 hrs</summary>
    A good overview course on molecular cell biology. The mechanisms of genome implementation, metabolism and signalling are considered. One can recommend the course before reading serious literature.

    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/60%20Biology/Intro%20to%20Physiology.pdf">Intro to Physiology</a> by SPBU, 27 hrs</summary>
    At one time, I learned some interesting points from this course, but in general, as a physiologist, I cannot recommend it either to the general public or to students in the first place. The course demonstrates interesting “trees”, behind which the “forest” is not visible. There was an impression that each lecturer simply spoke about his scientific interests but could not excitingly talk about the rest. The course covers physiology as a science, physiology of excitable tissues, nervous regulation of functions in the body, physiology of neuromuscular transmission, physiology of muscle contraction, autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary system and pineal gland, hormones of peripheral endocrine glands, general problems of the physiology of sensory systems and psychophysiological aspects of their functioning.

    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/60%20Biology/Openedu.%20Физиология%20ЦНС.png">Central Nervous System Physiology</a> by MSU, 108 hrs</summary>
    Quite a decent course for an introduction to neurobiology. General issues of the physiology of the central nervous system, neurotransmitter systems of the brain, physiology of structures and key functional blocks of the central nervous system are examined. The neurotransmitter systems are especially interesting, which provides good ground for independent study of psychopharmacology. Among the minuses, I will note practical tasks, for example, in the form of an essay.

## HTML/CSS
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/80%20Frontend/Indie%20HTML%20and%20CSS.pdf">Indie course on HTML and CSS</a> by A. Egorov, 3 hrs</summary>
    Quite enough to get started.
</details>

## Math
- <details>
    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/10%20Math/Math%20Logic%20and%20Theory%20of%20Algorithms.pdf">Math Logic & Algorithms Theory</a> by TUSUR University, 10 hrs</summary>
    The course as a whole is suitable as an introductory one, but the theory is presented rather dryly. Formalisms concerning the foundations of mathematical logic, set theory, propositional logic, first-order languages, the axiomatic method, mathematical proof, and the theory of algorithms are covered.
</details>

    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/10%20Math/Minimum%20in%20linear%20algebra.pdf">Minimum in Linear Algebra</a> by V. S. Zabolotskiy, 18 hrs</summary>
    The course is only suitable for reviewing material. The theory of matrices and determinants and systems of linear algebraic equations are examined. There are not enough examples to justify the need to use mathematical objects. Statements are proven by the word "obviously". What’s good: a skeleton is provided to hang meat using additional materials. The tasks correspond to the material. I solved some of them on paper, and with the help of others, I honed numpy.

    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/10%20Math/Basic%20Course%20of%20Math%20OGE%20preparation.pdf">OGE (basis of the USE)</a> by A. Zubakha, 23 hrs</summary>
    It is a solid course to refresh your school math curriculum. Transformations of algebraic expressions, systems of equations and inequalities, functions and their graphs, progressions, fundamentals of probability theory, and planimetry are considered.

    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/10%20Math/USE%20in%20Math%20-%20Coordinate-Vector%20Method.pdf">Analytic geometry for stereometric problems</a> by BEEGEEK, 21 hrs</summary>
    This course teaches you how to solve stereometric tasks from the Unified State Exam using analytical geometry of the type: drawing up equations of a straight line and a plane, and finding angles and distances in space. The theory is presented succinctly, in some places even too much - I did not have enough illustrations and mathematical proofs. There are a lot of well-designed problems.
</details>

## Philosophy of Science
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/70%20General/Scientific%20Thinking.pdf">Scientific Thinking</a> by SKB Kontur, 26 hrs</summary>
    I highly recommend taking it before starting research or before entering graduate school. The most interesting sections of the course are the history and philosophy of science, formal logic, critical analysis of statements, debating and scientific ethics. Of the minuses: there are controversial assignments (which was not a big problem until the author, for some reason, closed the comments) and tasks with checking by other students.
</details>

## Statistics
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/40%20Statistics/Basics%20of%20Statistics.pdf">Basics of Statistics</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 7 hrs</summary>
    One of the best survey courses in statistics. Basic concepts of biomedical statistics are discussed: measures of central tendency, basics of exploratory data analysis, central limit theorem (given not quite correctly), confidence intervals, statistical inference, t-distribution, analysis of variance, correlation and regression analysis.
</details>

- <details>
    <summary>★★★☆☆ <a href="Certificates/40%20Statistics/Data%20Analysis%20in%20R.pdf">Data Analysis in R</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 16 hrs</summary>
    The course covers the elements of working with statistics in the R program environment. The theory is minimal but generally sufficient. The syntax of R as applied to statistical calculations, descriptive statistics, graphing, analyzing nominal data, comparing groups, analysis of variance, and creating custom functions are covered. Correlation and multiple linear regression, methods of model selection and diagnosis are also discussed. A few words are devoted to logistic regression. Practical assignments are quite solvable, but their complexity and content do not correspond well to the theory presented.

## Python
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/PyGen%20for%20beginners%20(Python).pdf">"PyGen" for beginners</a> by BEEGEEK, 40 hrs (500 problems)</summary>
    It is an excellent course, absolutely recommended for beginners and those wishing to refresh their Python knowledge from the beginning. The theory is concise clear, but not dry. It is sufficient for solving the proposed problems. The tasks are well chosen: they not only reinforce the theory but also train algorithmic thinking. The course covers data input-output, integer arithmetic, conditional operator, basic data types, loops, indexing, slices, string methods, lists and their methods, list comprehension, sorting, functions with and without parameters, functions with value return, local and global scopes. At the end, mini-projects are given to consolidate the studied topics.

    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/PyGen%20for%20advanced%20(Python).pdf">"PyGen" for advanced</a> by BEEGEEK, 64 hrs (710 problems)</summary>
    A congenial continuation of the first part for beginners. Theory and practice are equally well presented. The course begins with tasks to review what was learned in the first course (or to determine the need to go through it first). Next, we examine the data type bool, NoneType, nested lists, matrices (tasks are outstanding, for example, traversing a matrix in a spiral), operations on them in mathematics, tuples, sets, frozenset, set generators, dictionaries, their methods and generators, random modules, string, decimal, fraction, complex, turtle, functions: optional and named arguments, functions with a variable number of arguments, programming paradigms, functions as objects, higher-order functions, map(), filter(), reduce(), anonymous functions, any(), all(), zip(), enumerate(), working with files (input-output).

    <summary>★★★★☆ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/Indie%20Python%20Programming%20Course.pdf">Indie Python Programming Course</a> by A. Egorov, 69 hrs</summary>
    Quite a good course. The theory is presented in a video, duplicated in text and interactively executed code. There are a lot of problems, and for the most part, they are suitable for reinforcing or reviewing a topic but could be a little more complicated. A pleasant surprise was the analysis of some topics usually classified as advanced. In addition to the standard topics in Python courses, some sorting algorithms, scopes, recursion, lambda, closures, decorators, working with modules, JSON, expressions and generator functions, map, filter, and zip are discussed; magic methods are briefly touched upon. Among the disadvantages are that the code sent for review passes few tests, the theory is not presented strictly enough in some places (sometimes this is an advantage), and issues when loading course pages with interactively executed code.

    <summary>★★☆☆☆ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/Python%20Programming.pdf">Python Programming</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 19 hrs</summary>
    It is not clear what audience this course is intended for. I definitely don't recommend starting your Python journey with it. The theory is given disgustingly fragmentarily and is not sufficient to solve the proposed problems. Personally, I took this course to solve problems - I don’t care where they came from. And, I must admit, some turned out to be amazingly original. A pleasant surprise was a task that involved using the “requests” module: open a file on the server, get a link to the next file, which contains a link to the next file... until you get to the last one.

    <summary>★★☆☆☆ <a href="Certificates/20%20Python/Python%20-%20Basics%20&%20Application.pdf">Python - Basics & Application</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 23 hrs</summary>
    A very controversial course. At first, the impression is highly positive: the theory is taught cheerfully, interestingly and somewhat deeper than in traditional courses for beginners. Actually, despite the name of this course, it is recommended that you take it if you are already familiar with Python. However, as soon as you have time to be charmed, the theory becomes outdated or erroneous (which is not corrected by anyone except commentators), and the tasks become disgustingly formulated and of little relevance. Apparently, the author is obsessed with graphs, so one will have to repeatedly emulate the dependencies of objects through these graphs and then somehow bypass them... despite the fact that algorithms and data structures are not understood at all. The course loses its consistency from the module on regular expressions and becomes chaotic. Overall, I would not recommend anything other than the video lectures from this course. From them, armed with comments, you can learn more deeply about the structure of the language, its standard tools and applications for text analysis (string methods, regular expressions, Internet queries, CSV, JSON, API, XML).

## SQL
- <details>
    <summary>★★★★★ <a href="Certificates/30%20SQL/SQL%20for%20everyone.pdf">SQL for everyone</a> by I. Kim, 11 hrs</summary>
    A short and particular course on SQL (MSSQL) - the best I've seen. Training takes place on an actual database using Azure Data Studio. Taught by a strong practitioner: nothing extra (for a data analyst) in theory, the tasks resemble real work. Syntax elements to learn: WHERE, LIKE, AND, OR, ORDER BY, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, AS, GROUP BY, HAVING, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, UNION (ALL), subqueries, CASE, popular functions to work with the strings. Self-test tasks are given both after each lesson on the topic of this lesson and at the end of the course.

## System administration
- <details>
    <summary>★★☆☆☆ <a href="Certificates/50%20System%20Administration/Introduction%20to%20Linux.pdf">Intro to Linux</a> by Bioinformatics Institute, 10 hrs</summary>
    An overview course for beginners getting to know Linux. There is a lot to see, but overall, it is not very good. The information is presented in a cluttered manner, and there are too many specific tasks. The course covers the basics of Terminal, launching executable files, input/output, downloading files, working with archives, searching for files and words in files, working on the server, bash scripts and more.
